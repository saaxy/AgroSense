## The features to be implemented in the farm assistant app:
### 1.	Predict best crop for the local soil and season
The app will suggest crops based on the type of soil and weather in the region of the farmland. It will take in the information about soil condition and weather type from the respective APIs available and use 3rd party AI’s or train our own AI models to come up with best results.
### 2.	Fertilizers’ guide for the suggested crop
After suggesting the most suitable crop, the app will also suggest the fertilizers to help in the growth of the crops. Primary suggestion would be natural fertilizers that would help in reducing cost for growing the crop. This information will be derived from government website or through local surveys. 
### 3.	Other costs from sowing to harvesting and till transportation (Cost tracker)
The app will have a dedicated tab where the farmer can track his cost for all the process and get suggestions to reduce the cost for one or more process to increase profits. 
### 4.	Give them the value of their crop
The app will help the farmers know the prices of their produced crop in the local or nearby markets. The app will also have an AI that will predict the prices on the next day or next week based on the previous weeks’ trend. 
### 5.	Notify famers about government schemes
The app will notify the farmers about local, state and central government body scheme based on their locations, type and condition of crops, and for other agricultural benefits.
### 6.	Local languages to connect with farmers better
The app will be available in the 22 scheduled languages of India and addition of language will be done based on farmer suggestion and expansion of app. For temporary basis, quick translation will be made available through Google translate or other translator apps.
